## System Overview

The College Internship Portal backend is built using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. It utilizes Express.js, a web application framework, to handle HTTP requests and provide the necessary endpoints for user and college registration, college search, and internship applications.

The system includes the following features:

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their personal information such as name, email, and password.

- **College Registration**: Colleges can register by providing their name, location, website, and other relevant details.

- **College Search**: Users can search for colleges based on various criteria such as location, field of study, and internship availability.

- **Internship Applications**: Users can apply for internships offered by colleges by submitting their application and relevant information.

## Installation

To install and run the College Internship Portal backend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd college-internship-portal-backend
   ```

4. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

5. Configure the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following variables:

   ```dotenv
   PORT=<port-number>
   DATABASE_URL=<database-url>
   ```

   Replace `<port-number>` with the desired port number for the server, and `<database-url>` with the URL for your database.

6. Run the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running on the specified port.

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or any HTTP client to interact with the College Internship Portal backend.
